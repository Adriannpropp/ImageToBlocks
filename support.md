# Support

If the mod isn't working, it's probably because you didn't read the [Tutorial](about.md). Go read that first.

## How to get help
If you've actually found a legitimate bug or the game is crashing even with **Smart Safety** turned on, you can message me on Discord.

**Discord Handle:** `mc_adriannn`

### Before you message me:
1. **Check your Base Color:** If your images are pink or grey, it's your fault. Set your Base Color to **BLACK** in the editor.
2. **Provide Logs:** If the game crashed, send the Geode crash log. "It doesn't work" is not a bug report; it's a waste of time.
3. **Be Patient:** I have a life. I'll reply when I can.

### Do NOT message me for:
* Asking how to install Geode.
* Asking for a mobile port (it happens when it happens).
* General "how do I use the editor" questions.

If you follow those rules, I'll probably help you. 👍
