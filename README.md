# ImageToBlocks

A Geode mod for Geometry Dash that turns your images into level objects without turning your PC into a space heater.

## Features
* **Smart Safety:** Automatically scales down quality so you don't accidentally try to spawn a million objects and crash your game.
* **Block Merging:** Smarter than your average importer. It groups similar pixels together into single, larger blocks using a greedy meshing algorithm to keep your object count low and your FPS high.
* **Interactive Tutorial:** built in step by step guide for the imports to look good, for it to work, read the tutorial in game or check out [Tutorial](about.md)
* **Background Processing:** the stuff is on a diff thread so ur ui doesnt kabum
